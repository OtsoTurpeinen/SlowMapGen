## Slow Map Generation Tool
I needed tool to visualize cellular automata based map generation. This tool does exactly that. I slowed down the generation to make it more interesting.

### Usage
Mouse to toggle the boolean values on the "filter".
Space to run the filter.
Enter to re-randomize initial state.
Up / Down arrow keys to change filter size.

### Credits
